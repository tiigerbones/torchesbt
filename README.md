# Realistic Torches BT

Realistic Torches BT makes fire-based light sources behave more dynamically and immersive.

## Features

- **Burn Time Management**: 
  - Torches, lanterns, and campfires burn out after configurable times.
  - Burn times and extinguish behavior are fully configurable in `config/torchesbt.json5`

- **Environmental Effects**:
  - Rain and water can extinguish light sources.
  - Multipliers for rain and water effects are configurable.

- **Reignition System**:
  - Relight extinguished torches, lanterns, and campfires using custom igniters (e.g., flint & steel, blaze rods).
  - Igniters and their effectiveness are defined in JSON: `data/torchesbt/igniters/`

- **Fueling System**:
  - Extend burn times with fuel items (e.g., coal, sticks).
  - Fuel definitions are data-driven via JSON: `data/torchesbt/fuels/`

- **Dynamic Lighting (Optional)**:
  - Toggleable dynamic lighting support.
  - Configurable via `config/torchesbt.json5`
 
- **Data-Driven Customization**:
  - All ignition and fuel behaviors are fully editable via JSON files, allowing easy modpack or server customization without code changes.

- **NOTES**:
  - Very early alpha â€” incompatibilities with other mods that modify torches, lanterns, or campfires are expected.
  - Gonna expand on this mod by adding compat to other mods slowly and adding new mechanics to keep torches, lanterns and campfires lit longer/indefinite

## Dependencies

- **Optional**: LambDynamicLights, Sodium Dynamic Lights
